title: Zaena

eyebrow: Zaena Business OS · Now Available

hero\_headline: Your entire business. Always in sync.

hero\_sub: A business operating system built for independent operators and growing companies. Sales, inventory, staff, compliance, and profit — from your phone or the web.

statement: Whether you run a sole proprietorship from your phone, or manage a registered company across multiple locations — Zaena gives you the same financial clarity that used to require an accountant, a laptop, and three different software subscriptions.

features\_title: Full Power. Zero Laptop.

features\_sub: Built for the market, the depot, and the workshop floor.

features:

&nbsp; - num: "01"

&nbsp;   title: Tap. Tap. Done.

&nbsp;   body: Complete a sale in seconds. No dropdowns, no multi-step wizards. The fastest POS you've used on a phone.

&nbsp; - num: "02"

&nbsp;   title: Separate your money.

&nbsp;   body: The profit allocation engine separates business revenue from personal take-home. Know exactly what is yours to spend.

&nbsp; - num: "03"

&nbsp;   title: Monitor staff from anywhere.

&nbsp;   body: Role-based access gives each staff member exactly the permissions they need — cashier, manager, director — and nothing more.

&nbsp; - num: "04"

&nbsp;   title: Receipts to WhatsApp.

&nbsp;   body: Every sale generates a professional receipt sent directly to your customer's WhatsApp. One tap from the sales screen.

&nbsp; - num: "05"

&nbsp;   title: Works when MTN doesn't.

&nbsp;   body: Offline-first architecture keeps Zaena running during network failures. Data syncs silently when you're back online.

&nbsp; - num: "06"

&nbsp;   title: Inventory that thinks ahead.

&nbsp;   body: Track stock levels across products. Get low-stock alerts before you run out. Every sale automatically updates inventory.

trust\_headline: Stop being invisible to capital.

trust\_body: Every transaction in Zaena is recorded in real time and sealed in a non-editable audit trail. Over time, this builds a verified financial reputation — a Trust Score — that banks, wholesalers, and institutional partners can read.

mode\_solo\_title: Start where you are.

mode\_solo\_body: You run a shop, a depot, a trade. No CAC number, no accountant, no problem. Zaena gives you the financial clarity and speed of a system built for serious business — from your phone.

mode\_company\_title: Scale with structure.

mode\_company\_body: You have a CAC registration, directors, and a team. Zaena's company mode handles CIT, director-level access, multi-user permissions, and full audit trails — from phone or full web dashboard.

compliance\_headline: Tax-man proof your business.

compliance\_body: PIT, CIT, and VAT are calculated natively on every transaction. You don't set anything up. You don't learn tax law. You just record sales, and Zaena keeps you audit-ready as a byproduct.

cta\_headline: Your business. Fully equipped.

cta\_sub: Download Zaena and run your entire operation from day one. No setup fee. No learning curve.
